                            The cast brass and cast stainless steel burners have the
                            smallest burrs — by far. This will mean less chaos in the gas
                            flow, fewer trapped particulate matter in the burner and a
                            cleaner burning grill. The following comparison shows how the
                            ports are formed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why is port formation important? Several reasons. If the hole is
                            punched into a sheet metal burner, it leaves a large tab inside
                            the burner that will caus e more chaos while burning. It is more
                            apt to hold trapped food particles and grease, and is therefore
                            more likely to burn through. (Note the Alfresco burner photo
                            below.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span>01.</span> Combine all of the ingredients, kneading to
                                form a smooth dough.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>02.</span> Allow the dough to rise, in a lightly
                                greased, covered bowl, until it’s doubled in size,
                            </li>
                            <li><span>03.</span> about 90 minutes.</li>
                            <li>
                                <span>04.</span> Gently divide the dough in half; it’ll
                                deflate somewhat. Gently shape the dough into two oval
                                loaves; or, for longer loaves, two 10″ to 11″ logs.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>05.</span> Place the loaves on a lightly greased or
                                parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let
                            </li>

                                <span>06.</span> rise until very puffy, about 1 hour.
                                Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven

                                <span>08.</span> Spray the loaves with lukewarm water. Make
                                two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each; a serrated bread
                                knife, wielded firmly,
                            </li>
